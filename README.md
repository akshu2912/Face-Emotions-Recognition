# Face-Emotions-Recognition

This project detects and classifies human emotions from facial expressions using deep learning. It leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a dataset of labeled facial images. The model predicts 7 emotions such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, disguished, and neutral. The system processes real-time video input or static images, analyzes facial features, and outputs the corresponding emotion. The project is implemented using Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow/Keras for image processing and model training. Ideal for applications in human-computer interaction, security, and sentiment analysis, this project offers an efficient and accurate way to assess emotions from facial expressions.
